yum2smart-convertor. 

The create-smart-channels.php script will create any missing smart
channel files from the equivalent yum repo files. Any new smart channel
files will be placed in a /new-smart-channels subdir of the yum repos
directory. Please see README.pdf for full details on how to use this script.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I wrote this yum2smart-converter script in 2009, while running Fedora
Linux. There were no smart channel configuration files then, and the
channels - aka repositories, had to be configured manually.

I originally released it on the Fedora forum under my forum name of CD-RW.

To make it easy for others to find all my work in one place, I'm moving
all my BSD-licensed code to my Github account:

All I ask is that you abide by the liberal BSD license, and give me the
credit for initial development of create-smart-channels.php. Any
feedback is welcome.
